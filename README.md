## Introduction

The rapid advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT) has paved the way for intelligent systems capable of monitoring and controlling various aspects of our environment. Among these critical areas, the detection of gases and flames plays a pivotal role in preventing accidents and safeguarding lives and property. This repository focuses on the design and implementation of a gas and flame detection system based on the versatile and accessible Arduino platform.

## Project Objective

The primary goal of this project is to develop a gas and flame detection system based on the Arduino platform.

## System Capabilities

- **Gas Detection**: The system employs the MQ-5 gas sensor to detect the presence of hazardous gases. It triggers an alert when a dangerous gas concentration is detected.
- **Flame Detection**: Equipped with the MH Infrared Flame Sensor Module, the system detects flames and promptly raises an alert upon detection.
- **Data Transmission**: The system gathers data from the sensors and processes it using the Arduino microcontroller.
- **Wireless Connectivity**: Processed data is transmitted from the Arduino to the WiFi module ESP-01, allowing for seamless database communication.
- **Alert Mechanisms**: The system can be configured to send email or SMS alerts in case of gas or flame detection.
